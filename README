Yet another reboot of dasEngine.

I am now using CMake for the build system for the libraries. This allows me
to build them for Visual C++ as well as the GNU compilers.

I have included the Android.cmake which goes in the Modules/Platform directory
of the CMake install. The Android_tc.cmake file is the toolchain file which
I can use to customize the options for dasEngine.

There is a cmake directory in each library that contains the bootstrap
script file to generate the initial Makefiles. The .gitignore is set up to
allow the build results to go there too.

dasEngine is based on the OGRE 3D renderer (which includes dependencies for
freetype, freeimage, and others).

OIS is used for the input system. It includes here the iPhone Multitouch patch
extended for Android as well, including the Accelerometer.

OpenAL is used for audio. This includes two ports: the OpenAL Soft library for
Windows and Linux. It'll also include an OpenAL implementation for Android
that is built from scratch (and no where near fully compliant).

Bullet Physics is used for the physics engine.

The dasEngine library brings it all together.

Eventually scripts for Blender will be included that support creating objects
and levels and exporting them into resource files that can be loaded into the
engine.
